Face Recognition with Arduino
Overview
This project demonstrates a face recognition system utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, a PC camera, and Python with the CVZone library. The PC camera captures images, which are processed using a Python-based face recognition algorithm from the CVZone library. The system then communicates with the Arduino to perform actions based on the recognition results, showcasing the synergy between computer vision and embedded systems.
